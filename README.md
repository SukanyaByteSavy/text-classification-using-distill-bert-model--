# 🌪️ Text Classification with DistilBERT

This project demonstrates how to perform **disaster tweet classification** using the DistilBERT transformer model. The goal is to classify tweets as either reporting a **real disaster** or not, leveraging the power of transfer learning with Hugging Face Transformers.

## 📁 Project Overview

This notebook walks through:

- Loading and preprocessing tweet data
- Tokenizing text with `DistilBERTTokenizerFast`
- Creating PyTorch Datasets and Dataloaders
- Fine-tuning the `distilbert-base-uncased` model on labeled tweet data
- Evaluating performance on a test set

## 🧠 Model

We use [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased), a smaller and faster version of BERT, pre-trained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is a binary classification dataset of tweets, each labeled as:

- `1`: Tweet reports a real disaster
- `0`: Tweet is not about a real disaster

*Note:* The dataset should be loaded and preprocessed appropriately as shown in the notebook.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-classification-distilbert.git
   cd text-classification-distilbert
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook:
   Open `Text_Classification_with_DistilBERT.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE and run the cells step by step.

## 📈 Results

The notebook includes performance evaluation (accuracy, classification report) and visualizations such as:

- Training loss over epochs
- Confusion matrix
- Sample predictions

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- scikit-learn
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
- Better handling of class imbalance
- Model export and deployment

Would you like me to generate a `requirements.txt` too, or add a section for downloading the dataset if it’s public?
